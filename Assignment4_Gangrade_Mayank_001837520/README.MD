## Problem Statement
Your task is to implement a parallel sorting algorithm such that each partition of the array is sorted in parallel. You should consider two different schemes for deciding whether to sort in parallel.

A cutoff (defaults to, say, 1000) which you will update according to the first argument in the command line when running. It's your job to experiment and come up with a good value for this cutoff. If there are fewer elements to sort than the cutoff, then you should use the system sort instead.
Recursion depth or number of available threads. Using this determination, you might decide on an ideal number (t) of separate threads (stick to powers of 2) and arrange for that number of partitions to be parallelized (by preventing recursion after depth of lg t is reached).
An appropriate combination of these.
There is a Main class and the ParSort class in the sort.par package of the INFO6205 repository. The Main class can be used as is but the ParSort class needs to be implemented where you see "TODO..."

Unless you have a good reason not to, you should just go along with the Java8-style future implementations provided for you.
